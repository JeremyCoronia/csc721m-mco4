# Stock Market Prediction

Machine project in partial fulfillment of the requirements in the class CSC721M (DLSU-M). We used a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to perform stock market prediction. Parameters were explored as to how they affect the accuract in stock market prediction, such as changing the number of LSTM layers, and changing the value of the dropout or learning rate. 

## Data used

We used two (2) datasets for this experiment. FIrstly, we use the historical stock data of Google from July 6, 2005 until July 6, 2022. The second, larger and more volatile dataset is the HP dataset from January 2, 1970 until November 10, 2017. This dataset is used to test the robustness of the LSTM model after singling out best performance settings.
